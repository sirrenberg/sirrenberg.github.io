## Description
I created my portfolio website with Vite, React, and TypeScript and uses the React-Bootstrap library for styling. The website is a single-page application that showcases my projects, skills, and contact information. The website is responsive and can be viewed on mobile devices as well as desktops.

The website is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](https://www.sirrenberg.net/).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository with `git clone git@github.com:sirrenberg/sirrenberg.github.io.git`
2. move into the directory with `cd sirrenberg.github.io`
3. Make sure you have the latest version of npm and vite installed
   - check your version of npm with `npm -v` which should be at least 10.5.0
   - run `npm install -g npm@latest` to update npm if necessary
4. run `npm install` to install the dependencies
5. run `npm run dev` to start the development server
